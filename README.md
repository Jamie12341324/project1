# Structure Plane
## Wireframes made in penpot
* Apart from my home page which dosen't use boostrap grids all of my 3 other pages have the same wireframes
because they all have the same structure apart from which background image, text and video they have
they are the same
* Apart from my home page my other pages are responsive when you change the size of the screen the
tables stack on top of eachother using a boostrap grid system
* while using penpot I had the issue of exporting the wireframes I had made which didn't work very well
because I only seemed to be able to download one file even though there were 5 so I had to move each one to the top
of the list before exporting it. Later markdown was unable to show any of my PDFs so I used snipping tool to get the wireframe
images that I actually used in my readme file which the links to are below

# Testing
# problem 1
The navbar button wasn't working and when you click on it nothing happens the issue was I was missing a 
link from bootstrap that goes at the end of your code just before the closing body tag.
---
![image of navbar button having dropped down like it is meant to](assets/images/images-for-readme/error1.PNG "navbar button")
---
The issue here was the navbar appears on the side of the screen instead of the top to fix this I added the fixed-top class to the
nav tag
---
![image of side navbar](assets/images/images-for-readme/error2.PNG)
---
Here you can see the newer version with the navbar at the top
---
![image of fixed top navbar](assets/images/images-for-readme/error3.PNG)
---
Orignally the red background was on top of the footer so it looked like part of the footer was missing
if I remember correctly I fixed this problem by adding the fixed-bottom class to the footer
---
![fixed footer](assets/images/images-for-readme/error4.PNG)
---
This is a failed attempt to fix the same problem
---
![broken footer](assets/images/images-for-readme/error5.PNG)
---
This is a image of a fixed url that had ../assets at the start instead of ../images
---
![fixed url](assets/images/images-for-readme/error6.PNG)
---
For a while when I was trying to use an iframe to embed a youtube video I got an error 153
however when you look at the page from github as a deployed site the video/iframe works
---
![working video](assets/images/images-for-readme/error7.PNG)
---
Orginally when the header position was fixed it moved down with the navbar which I thought looked wrong
I also tried a postion relative but that brought back the problem with the footer so in the end I used
a position absolute which works
---
![working header position](assets/images/images-for-readme/error8.PNG)
---
When I first made the table for age and height the columns were to close together so I
tested a style with extra width in the end I made a class called table-1 with set the width
to 150 solving the isssue so that the is enough distence between the columns so that you can read the text
---
![table styling](assets/images/images-for-readme/error9.PNG)
---
This is what the table looked like after it had been styled
---
![table with extra width](assets/images/images-for-readme/error10.PNG)
---
When I first did this class I forgot a few selectors like div tr
---
![table class with the right selectors](assets/images/images-for-readme/error11.PNG)
---
First I tired to import a button from boostrap
---
![button tag](assets/images/images-for-readme/error12.PNG)
---
I needed a link from the book now button to the booking-form page but the a link made the text
on the button blue and highlighted
---
![button with a tag and highlighted blue text](assets/images/images-for-readme/error13.PNG)
---
I tried making my own button but it took up the whole screen so I scraped it
---
![](assets/images/images-for-readme/error14.PNG)
---
I changed my button so that the button tag was inside an a tag instead of it being the other way around
this solved the issue of th whole button going white when you hovered over the very edge (when you hover over the
text the text goes black so you can still see it) thi might be because I had some styles for the a and button tag 
that were pretty much the same and the bootstrap was overwriting the button tag class but not the a tag so things only 
chnaged while you hover over the a tag which just has text
![a and button tags in the right order](assets/images/images-for-readme/error15.PNG)

# html validator
These are the issues I got when I put my index.html page into html validator.
![The problems I had when I first put my index.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/index-html-validator.PNG)
---
Here we have a tag I deleted like the validator suggested.
---
![tag ending problem](assets/images/images-for-readme/index-valid1.PNG)
---
According to the html validator I should not have this frameborder attribute so I got rid of it.
---
![frameborder problem](assets/images/images-for-readme/index-valid2.PNG)
---
I was missing a main closing tag so I added one in and it looks like this and after I put my page back into the validator it said
there were no errors.
---
![missing closing tag](assets/images/images-for-readme/index-valid3.PNG)
---
These are the issues I got when I put my godzilla.html page into html validator.
![The problems I had when I first put my godzilla.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/godzilla-html-validator.PNG)
---
![](assets/images/images-for-readme/godzilla-html-valid-fix1.PNG)
---
Here there was a / for no apparent readon so I got rid of it.
---
![](assets/images/images-for-readme/godzilla-html-valid-fix2.PNG)
---
Here the validator picked up that there was a p tag that was closed but never opened so I removed it
There was also a frameborder that got removed just like with the index.html page. After putting
the page back into the validator there were no more errors.
---
These are the issues I got when I put my king-ghidorah.html page into html validator
![The problems I had when I first put my king-ghidorah.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/king-ghidorah-html-validator.PNG)
---
There was also a frameborder that got removed just like with the index.html page and also similarly a / that I removed I also add a closing
main tag. None of which I have images for king-ghidorah because I already have a image of all those issues for other pages. After putting
the page back into the validator there were no more errors.
---
These are the issues I got when I put my rodan.html page into html validator
![The problems I had when I first put my rodan.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/rodan-html-validator.PNG)
---
All the issues with the rodan page were the same as the king-ghidorah page and now the validator says there are no errors.
---
These are the issues I got when I put my booking-form.html page into html validator
![The problems I had when I first put my booking-form.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/booking-form-html-validator.PNG)
---
![form with no white spacing](assets/images/images-for-readme/booking-forn-validator1.PNG)
Here there was the issue with the random / which has now been removed. The other six issues are pretty much the same issue were I incorrectly used white space on a label id but 3 times for input tags and 3 times for label tags.
---
My success page had no errors when I put through the html validator
# css validator
The first time I put my css into the validator it said there were no errors so I don't have any issue fixing for it.
